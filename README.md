# AUD-CMA-v2
Drag-and-Carry Multiplication Algorithm v2

The Ahmet Ulucay Drag-and-Carry Multiplication Algorithm (AUD&CMA v2) introduces a novel approach to digit-wise multiplication by combining structured positional padding, convolution-like window sliding, and a specialized right-to-left carry mechanism. Unlike traditional methods that rely on place value decomposition or lattice grids, AUD&CMA v2 applies a reversed-digit kernel (from the multiplier) over the padded multiplicand, computing localized dot-products across digit windows.

This hybrid method integrates discrete convolution principles with mental-math-friendly carry handling, where all digit sums are reduced to single digits via right-to-left propagation, except for the leftmost value, which is preserved in full. The algorithmâ€™s unique structure and deterministic steps distinguish it both theoretically and practically from classical multiplication strategies.
