Feature / Method,Traditional Multiplication,AUD&CMA v1,AUD&CMA v2,Lattice Multiplication,Russian Peasant Multiplication
Approach,Positional (row-wise product),Positional + convolution-style drag & carry,Sliding window convolution + drag & carry,Grid-based with diagonal summation,Doubling and halving with conditional addition
Carry Direction,Right → Left,Right → Left (with preserved leftmost),Right → Left (with preserved leftmost),Right → Left (diagonally),Top-down calculation
Preserve Leftmost Digit,No,Yes,Yes,No,No
Use of Zero Padding,No,Yes (k-1 zeros on each side),"Yes (k-1 zeros on each side, used as sliding window)",No,No
Number Format Handling,Full multiplication,"Repetitive/mirror-like numbers (11, 111, 222, etc.)",Generalized base numbers (still with patterns),Any numbers,Any integers
Output Composition,Full multi-digit result,Single digits with carry sum; leftmost untouched,"Convolution output per window, digit-wise adjustment","Digit-wise, summed through diagonals",Summed conditionally
Algorithm Uniqueness,Common,Novel,Novel,Classic alternative method,Traditional method
Mental Math Friendliness,Moderate,High (educational and visual aid),"High (mental patterning, abstraction)",Low,Moderate
Suitable For,All general cases,"Mental math, educational visuals, limited hardware","Visualization, educational tools, pattern-based systems","Visualization, teaching multiplication",History and simplification of doubling
Application in Embedded Systems,Complex,Efficient in low-power environments (no full mult logic),"Efficient; pattern-oriented, avoids full multi-logic",Inefficient,Very efficient
Digit Carry Complexity,Standard,"Custom rule (carry sum to left, keep leftmost as-is)","Same as v1, but within sliding window scope",Medium,Simple logic
Preserved Properties Across Versions,N/A,"Leftmost value preserved, carry limited",Same as v1 + convolution padding method,None,None
